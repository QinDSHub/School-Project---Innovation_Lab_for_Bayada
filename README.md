1. Client Requirement
As a user of this course, Bayada raised the following key question:
“How can the onboarding process be leveraged to strengthen the relationship between staff and client families in a sustainable and scalable way?”

2. Key Insights Derived from the Requirement
Based on this question, we identified several critical insights:

(1) The solution must be implemented during or before the onboarding process, rather than after onboarding is completed.

(2) The primary goal is to strengthen the relationship between nurses and client families, not merely to complete operational onboarding tasks.

(3) Beyond first impressions
While a positive onboarding experience helps establish a good first impression, it alone is insufficient to unlock long-term value.

A strong and sustained relationship can lead to:
 - Extended contract durations
 - Renewal of existing contracts
 - Client referrals to Bayada

To achieve these outcomes, relationship-building must be embedded into the app in a holistic, systematic, and user-friendly manner, rather than relying on isolated or manual efforts.

3. Proposed Solutions
Based on the above analysis, we propose the following recommendations:

(1) Detail-Driven Onboarding Experience
We recommend enhancing the onboarding experience by focusing on thoughtful operational details, including:
 - Full team participation when onboarding visiting client families, to create a sense of professionalism and trust
 - Time-limited home visits to minimize inconvenience for client families
 - Bayada-branded souvenirs (e.g. canvas bags with the Bayada logo), serving both as relationship starters and subtle marketing tools
 - A 48-hour feedback mechanism integrated into the existing app, particularly tailored to the onboarding phase, to capture early impressions and address concerns promptly

(2) Intelligent Recommendation Algorithm (Key Innovation,only one who came up the idea)
We propose introducing an intelligent nurse recommendation system to support Care Nurse Managers (CNMs).
The system recommends:
 - Top 3 primary nurses
 - Top 3 shadow nurses

Recommendations are based on multidimensional data, including:
 - Schedule availability
 - Geographic proximity
 - Professional qualifications and levels
 - Personality traits and hobbies
Final selection remains with the CNM, ensuring human oversight.

Additionally, one nurse or shadow nurse from the shortlisted candidates can be designated as a backup, ensuring service continuity during holidays or sick leave.

Key benefits:
 - Reduces CNM workload
 - Alleviates nurse shortages in the healthcare industry
 - Improves work–life balance for nurses
 - Enhances consistency and reliability of care for client families

(3) Standardized Professional Processes & Healthcare Training
To ensure consistent service quality, we recommend:
 - Automated distribution of tailored training modules during onboarding
 - Training differentiated by:International nurses、Part-time nurses、Different professional seniority levels
This approach ensures both duty nurses and shadow nurses are well-prepared, professional, and aligned with client family expectations.

(4) Fostering Sustainable Relationships via App Features
While these features may not directly impact immediate onboarding outcomes, they are essential for building long-term, sustainable relationships:
 - Daily and weekly shift schedules displayed in the app to help nurses prepare in advance
 - Check-in and check-out functionality for each client visit, enabling accurate service records and reminders for future visits
 - Embedded client satisfaction feedback tools, guiding nurses toward better service behaviors
 - Behavioral performance analytics linked to bonus or incentive mechanisms, reinforcing high-quality care
